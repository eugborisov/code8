                    I was working on an offer set which included some Trish McEvoy Eye Shadow. When I searched this it pulled up tons of partner options, however, half of them don't have images and the titles don't include a variant. A few of these had repeated titles which I believe are the different variants available. I can collect it to my offer but if I try to update it or choose the add a variant selection, it doesn't allow me to source as partner after. If you search Trish McEvoy it brings up quite a few products with the same issue. Some missing images or repeated titles most likely missing the specific variant. I had to scrape the item in like new just to make sure we get the correct product if she converts.
